In this will blog i will try to introduce you with **Python Pickle** , i got to learn from BlackHat Trainer **Sunil Yadav**.

[](#header-1)**Introduction to Pickle**

The **Pickle** module helps you serializing and deserializing data. Using this module we can try to convert a python object in chunk of bytes and then rebuild (chunked objects) in a different process or environment by loading that chunk of bytes.

---
[](#header-2)**How it Works?**
---

For serializing objects we use **pickle.dumps()** :

        import pickle
        pickle.dumps(['pickle','bond',1,2,3])

Pickled Representation using **dumps** is :
    
    b'\x80\x04\x95\x1b\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00]\x94(\x8c\x06pickle\x94\x8c\x04bond\x94K\x01K\x02K\x03e.'

Here's how we can Serialize data :
